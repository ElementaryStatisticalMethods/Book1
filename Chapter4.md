## Practice Data Sets 

### Data set on air quality in Indian cities. 
We can understand the detailed process of retaining only the relevant information and 
also standardising the data using the standard normal distribution for analysis.

### Dataset from an electric car-sharing service company called Autolib.
The project is about using hypothesis testing and investigating a claim on blue car usage 
rates in Paris and Hauts-de-Seineconcept (French cities).

### Market research for a box company from Tustin, CA
This research consists of responses from 5,000 Californians. Concepts from interval 
estimation and hypothesis testing are used to predict the preferred type of boxes that will 
be sold in the next few months.
