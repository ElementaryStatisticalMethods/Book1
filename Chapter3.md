## Some research articles on the Normal distribution:

1. Title: Genetic algorithms and Gaussian Bayesian networks to uncover the predictive core 
set of bibliometric indices. 
We use Gaussian Bayesian networks to solve this problem and discover multivariate relationships 
among bibliometric indices. These networks are learnt by a genetic algorithm that looks for the 
optimal models that best predict bibliometric data. Results show that the optimal induced 
Gaussian Bayesian networks corroborate previous relationships between several indices, but also 
suggest new, previously unreported interactions. Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology Volume 67, Issue 7.

Title: Happiness is not normally distributed: A comment to Delhey and Kohler
Author: Wim Kalmijn. Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Delhey and Kohler assume that the happiness distribution at the population level is 
essentially normal, but this is distorted by the fact that happiness is measured in samples 
using scales that are discrete and two-sided bounded. This assumption is tested using the 
probability method and rejected.
